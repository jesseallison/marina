For my poems, written so young
I’d not dreamed I was a poet,
Like drops from the fountain flung,
Like sparks from a rocket,

That burst into the realm of true
Sleep, and incense, like tiny demons,
For my poems about death and youth,
– For my unread sermons! –

Scattered in dusty stores, in line,
Where, un-purchased, they are dumb,
For my poems, like precious wine,
A time will come.
