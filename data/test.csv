don't,https://www.ted.com/talks/barbara_natterson_horowitz_what_veterinarians_know_that_doctors_don_t?language=en,14-Sep,Barbara Natterson-Horowitz,"1,346,703","Animals,Biology,Evolution,Medicine,Mental health","Ten years ago,I got a phone call thatchanged my life.At the time, I was cardiologist at UCLA,specializing in cardiac imaging techniques.The call came from a veterinarianat the Los Angeles Zoo.An elderly female chimpanzeehad woken up with a facial droopand the veterinarians were worriedthat she'd had a stroke.They asked if I'd come to the zooand image the animal's heartto look for a possiblecardiac cause.Now, to be clear, North Americanzoos are staffedby highly qualified, board-certified veterinarianswho take outstanding care of their animal patients.But occasionally, they do reach into the human medical community,particularly for some speciality consultation,and I was one of the lucky physicianswho was invited in to help.I had a chance to rule outa stroke in this chimpanzeeand make sure that this gorilla didn't have a torn aorta,evaluate this macawfor a heart murmur,make sure that this California sea lion'sparicardium wasn't inflamed,and in this picture, I'm listeningto the heart of a lionafter a lifesaving, collaborative procedurewith veterinarians and physicianswhere we drained 700 cc's of fluid from the sacin which this lion's heart was contained.And this procedure, which I havedone on many human patients,was identical, with the exceptionof that paw and that tail.Now most of the time, I was workingat UCLA Medical Center with physicians,discussing symptomsand diagnoses and treatmentsfor my human patients,but some of the time,I was working at the Los Angeles Zoowith veterinarians, discussing symptoms and diagnoses and treatmentsfor their animal patients.And occasionally, on the very same day,I went on rounds at UCLA Medical Centerand at the Los Angeles Zoo.And here's what started cominginto very clear focus for me.Physicians and veterinarianswere essentially taking careof the same disorders in their animal and human patients:congestive heart failure, brain tumors,leukemia, diabetes, arthritis, ALS, breast cancer,even psychiatric syndromeslike depression, anxiety,compulsions, eating disordersand self-injury.Now, I've got a confession to make.Even though I studied comparativephysiology and evolutionary biologyas an undergrad --I had even written my senior thesis on Darwinian theory --learning about the significant overlapbetween the disorders of animals and humans,it came as a much needed wake-up call for me.So I started wondering,with all of these overlaps,how was it that I had neverthought to ask a veterinarian,or consult the veterinary literature,for insights into one of my human patients?Why had I never, nor had any of my physician friends and colleagueswhom I asked, ever attended a veterinary conference?For that matter, why was any of this a surprise?I mean, look, every single physicianaccepts some biological connectionbetween animals and humans.Every medication that we prescribeor that we've taken ourselvesor we've given to our familieshas first been tested on an animal.But there's something very differentabout giving an animal a medication or a human diseaseand the animal developing congestive heart failureor diabetes or breast cancer on their own.Now, maybe some of the surprisecomes from the increasingseparation in our worldbetween the urban and the nonurban.You know, we hear about these city kidswho think that wool grows on treesor that cheese comes from a plant.Well, today's human hospitals,increasingly, are turning into thesegleaming cathedrals of technology.And this creates a psychologicaldistance between the human patientswho are being treated thereand animal patients whoare living in oceansand farms and jungles.But I think there's an even deeper reason.Physicians and scientists, we acceptintellectually that our species,Homo sapiens, is merely one species,no more unique orspecial than any other.But in our hearts, we don't completely believe that.I feel it myself when I'm listening to Mozartor looking at pictures of the Mars Rover on my MacBook.I feel that tug of human exceptionalism,even as I recognize the scientifically isolating costof seeing ourselves as asuperior species, apart.Well, I'm trying these days.When I see a human patientnow, I always ask,what do the animal doctors knowabout this problem that I don't know?And, might I be taking better care of my human patientif I saw them as a humananimal patient?Here are a few examples of the kind of exciting connectionsthat this kind of thinking has led me to.Fear-induced heart failure.Around the year 2000,human cardiologists ""discovered""emotionally induced heart failure.It was described in a gambling father who had lost his life's savingswith a roll of the dice,in a bride who'dbeen left at the alter.But it turns out, this ""new"" human diagnosiswas neither new, norwas it uniquely human.Veterinarians had been diagnosing, treating and even preventingemotionally inducedsymptoms in animalsranging from monkeys to flamingos,from to deer to rabbits,since the 1970s.How many human lives might have been savedif this veterinary knowledgehad been put into the handsof E.R. docs and cardiologists?Self-injury.Some human patients harm themselves.Some pluck out patches of hair,others actually cut themselves.Some animal patients also harm themselves.There are birds that pluck out feathers.There are stallions that repetitivelybite their flanks until they bleed.But veterinarians have very specificand very effective waysof treating and evenpreventing self-injuryin their self-injuring animals.Shouldn't this veterinary knowledgebe put into the handsof psychotherapists and parents and patientsstruggling with self-injury?Postpartum depression and postpartum psychosis.Sometimes, soon after giving birth,some women become depressed,and sometimes they become seriously depressed and even psychotic.They may neglect their newborn,and in some extreme cases,even harm the child.Equine veterinarians alsoknow that occasionally,a mare, soon after giving birth,will neglect the foal,refusing to nurse,and in some instances,kick the foal, even to death.But veterinarians have devisedan intervention to deal withthis foal rejection syndromethat involves increasing oxytocin in the mare.Oxytocin is the bonding hormone,and this leads to renewed interest,on the part of the mare, in her foal.Shouldn't this informationbe put into the hands of ob/gyn'sand family doctors and patientswho are struggling with postpartumdepression and psychosis?Well, despite all of this promise,unfortunately the gulf betweenour fields remains large.To explain it, I'm afraid I'm going to have to air some dirty laundry.Some physicians can be real snobsabout doctors who are not M.D.'s.I'm talking about dentists and optometrists and psychologists,but maybe especially animal doctors.Of course, most physiciansdon't realize that it is harderto get into vet school thesedays than medical school,and that when we go to medical school,we learn everything there is to knowabout one species, Homo sapiens,but veterinarians need to learnabout health and diseasein mammals, amphibians,reptiles, fish and birds.So I don't blame the vetsfor feeling annoyedby my profession'scondescension and ignorance.But here's one from the vets:What do you call a veterinarianwho can only take care of one species?A physician. (Laughter)Closing the gap has become a passion for me,and I'm doing this through programslike Darwin on Rounds at UCLA,where we're bringing animal experts and evolutionary biologistsand embedding themon our medical teamswith our interns and our residents.And through Zoobiquity conferences,where we bring medical schools together with veterinary schoolsfor collabortive discussionsof the shared diseases and disordersof animal and human patients.At Zoobiquity conferences,participants learn how treatingbreast cancer in a tigercan help us better treat breast cancerin a kindergarten teacher;how understanding polycysticoveries in a Holstein cowcan help us better take careof a dance instructor with painful periods;and how better understanding the treatment of separation anxietyin a high-strung Sheltiecan help an anxious young childstruggling with his first days of school.In the United States and now internationally, at Zoobiquity conferencesphysicians and veterinarians check their attitudes and their preconceptionsat the door and come together as colleagues,as peers, as doctors.After all, we humans are animals, too,and it's time for us physicians to embraceour patients' and our own animal naturesand join veterinariansin a species-spanning approach to health.Because it turns out,some of the best and most humanistic medicineis being practiced by doctorswhose patients aren't human.And one of the best ways we can take careof the human patient is by paying close attentionto how all the other patients on the planetlive, grow, get sick and heal.Thank you.(Applause)."Technology crafts for the digitally underserved,https://www.ted.com/talks/vinay_venkatraman_technology_crafts_for_the_digitally_underserved?language=en,12-Apr,Vinay Venkatraman,"562,578","TEDx,Global issues,Technology","Frugal Digital is essentially a small research group at C.I.D.where we are looking to findalternate visions of how to create a digitally inclusive society.That's what we're after.And we do this because we actually believethat silicon technology today is mostly abouta culture of excess.It's about the fastest and the most efficientand the most dazzling gadget you can have,while about two-thirds of the worldcan hardly reach the most basic of this technologyto even address fundamental needs in life,including health care, educationand all these kinds of very fundamental issues.So before I start, I want to talk about a little anecdote,a little story about a man I met once in Mumbai.So this man, his name is Sathi Shri.He is an outstanding person,because he's a small entrepreneur.He runs a little shopin one of the back streets of Mumbai.He has this little 10-square-meter store,where so much is being done.It's incredible, because I couldn't believe my eyeswhen I once just happened to bump into him.Basically, what he does is, he has all these servicesfor micro-payments and booking ticketsand all kinds of basic things that you would go online for,but he does it for people offlineand connects to the digital world.More importantly, he makes his moneyby selling these mobile recharge coupons, you know,for the prepaid subscriptions.But then, in the backside, he's got this little nookwith a few of his employeeswhere they can fix almost anything.Any cell phone, any gadget you can bring them, they can fix it.And it's pretty incredible because I took my iPhone there,and he was like, ""Yeah, do you want an upgrade?""""Yes."" (Laughter)I was a bit skeptical, but then, I decidedto give him a Nokia instead. (Laughter)But what I was amazed about is this reverse engineeringand know-how that's built into this little two meters of space.They have figured out everything that's requiredto dismantle, take things apart,rewrite the circuitry, re-flash the firmware,do whatever you want to with the phone,and they can fix anything so quickly.You can hand over a phone this morningand you can go pick it up after lunch,and it was quite incredible.But then we were wondering whether this isa local phenomenon, or is truly global?And, over time, we started understandingand systematically researchingwhat this tinkering ecosystem is about,because that is something that's happeningnot just in one street corner in Mumbai.It's actually happening in all parts of the country.It's even happening in Africa, like, for example,in Cape Town we did extensive research on this.Even here in Doha I found this little nookwhere you can get alarm clocks and watches fixed,and it's a lot of tiny little parts. It's not easy.You've got to try it on your own to believe it.But what fuels this?It's this entire ecosystem of low-cost partsand supplies that are produced all over the world, literally,and then redistributed to basically service this industry,and you can even buy salvaged parts.Basically, you don't have to necessarily buybrand new things. You have condemned computersthat are stripped apart,and you can buy salvaged componentsand things that you can reassemble in a new configuration.But what does this new, sort of, approach give us?That's the real question, because this is somethingthat's been there, part of every societythat's deprived of enough resources.But there's an interesting paradigm.There's the traditional crafts,and then there's the technology crafts.We call it the technology crafts because these are emerging.They're not something that's been established.It's not something that's institutionalized.It's not taught in universities.It's taught [by] word of mouth,and it's an informal education system around this.So we said, ""What can we get out of this?You know, like, what are the key values that we can get out of this?""The main thing is a fix-it-locally culture,which is fantastic because it means that your productor your service doesn't have to go througha huge bureaucratic system to get it fixed.It also affords us cheap fabrication, which is fantastic,so it means that you can do a lot more with it.And then, the most important thing is,it gives us large math for low cost.So it means that you can actually embedpretty clever algorithms and lots of other kindsof extendable ideas into really simple devices.So, what we call this is a silicon cottage industry.It's basically what was the system or the paradigmbefore the industrial revolution is now re-happeningin a whole new way in small digital shopsacross the planet in most developing countries.So, we kind of toyed around with this idea,and we said, ""What can we do with this?Can we make a little product or a service out of it?""So one of the first things we did is this thing calleda multimedia platform. We call it a lunch box.Basically one of the contexts that we studied wasschools in very remote parts of India.So there is this amazing concept called the one-teacher school,which is basically a single teacher who is a multitaskerwho teaches this amazing little social setting.It's an informal school,but it's really about holistic education.The only thing that they don't haveis access to resources. They don't even have a textbooksometimes, and they don't even have a proper curriculum.So we said, ""What can we do to empower this teacherto do more?"" How to access the digital world?Instead of being the sole guardian of information,be a facilitator to all this information.So we said, ""What are the steps required to empower the teacher?""How do you make this teacher into a digital gateway,and how do you design an inexpensive multimedia platformthat can be constructed locally and serviced locally?""So we walked around.We went and scavenged the nearby markets,and we tried to understand, ""What can we pick up that will make this happen?""So the thing that we gotwas a little mobile phone with a little pico projectorthat comes for about 60 dollars.We went a bought a flashlight with a very big battery,and a bunch of small speakers.So essentially, the mobile phone gives usa connected multimedia platform.It allows us to get online and allows us to load up filesof different formats and play them.The flashlight gives us this really intense, bright L.E.D.,and six hours worth of rechargeable battery pack,and the lunch box is a nice little packagein which you can put everything inside,and a bunch of mini speakers to sort ofamplify the sound large enough.Believe me, those little classrooms are really noisy.They are kids who scream at the top of their voices,and you really have to get above that.And we took it back to this little tinkering setupof a mobile phone repair shop,and then the magic happens.We dismantle the whole thing,we reassemble it in a new configuration,and we do this hardware mashup,systematically training the guy how to do this.Out comes this, a little lunch box -- form factor.(Applause)And we systematically field tested,because in the field testing we learned someimportant lessons, and we went through many iterations.One of the key issues was battery consumption and charging.Luminosity was an issue, when you have too much bright sunlight outside.Often the roofs are broken, so you don't have enoughdarkness in the classroom to do these things.We extended this idea. We tested it many times over,and the next version we came up with was a boxthat kind of could trickle charge on solar energy,but most importantly connect to a car battery,because a car battery is a ubiquitous source of powerin places where there's not enough electricityor erratic electricity.And the other key thing that we did wasmake this box run off a USB key, because we realizedthat even though there was GPRS and all that on paper,at least, in theory, it was much more efficientto send the data on a little USB key by surface mail.It might take a few days to get there,but at least it gets there in high definitionand in a reliable quality.So we made this box, and we tested it againand again and again, and we're going throughmultiple iterations to do these things.But it's not limited to just education.This kind of a technique or metrologycan actually be applied to other kinds of areas,and I'm going to tell you one more little story.It's about this little device called a medi-meter.It's basically a little health care screening tool that we developed.In India, there is a context of these amazing people,the health care workers called ASHA workers.They are essentially foot soldiers for the health care systemwho live in the local community and are trainedwith basic tools and basic concepts of health care,and the main purpose is basically to inform peopleto basically, how to lead a better life, but alsoto divert or sort of make recommendationsof what kind of health care should they approach?They are basically referral services, essentially.But the problem with that is that we realizedafter a bunch of research that they are amazingat referring people to the nearest clinicor the public health care system, but what happens at thepublic health care system is this: these incredibly long linesand too many people who overload the systemsimply because there's not enough doctors and facilitiesfor the population that's being referred.So everything from a common coldto a serious case of malaria gets almost the samelevel of attention, and there's no priorities.So we said, ""Come on, there's got to be a better wayof doing this for sure.""So we said, ""What can we do with the ASHA workerthat'll allow this ASHA worker to become an interesting filter,but not just a filter, a really well thought through referralsystem that allows load balancing of the network,and directs patients to different sources of health carebased on the severity or the criticalness of those situations?""So the real key question was,how do we empower this woman?How do we empower her with simple toolsthat's not diagnostic but more screening in natureso she at least knows how to advise the patients better?And that'll make such a huge difference on the system,because the amount of waiting time and the amount ofdistances that people need to travel, often sometimesseven to 15 kilometers, sometimes by foot,to get a simple health check done, is very, very detrimentalin the sense that it really dissuades peoplefrom getting access to health care.So if there was something that she could do,that would be amazing.So what we did was that we converted this deviceinto a medical device.I want to demo this actually,because it's a very simple process.Bruno, do you want to join us? (Cheers)Come along. (Applause)So, what we're going to do is thatwe're going to measure a few basic parameters on you,including your pulse rate and the amount of oxygenthat's there in your blood.So you're going to put your thumb on top of this.Bruno Giussani: Like this, works?Vinay Venkatraman: Yeah. That's right. BG: Okay.VV: So I'm going to start it up. I hope it works.(Beeps) It even beeps, because it's an alarm clock, after all.So ... (Laughter)So I take it into the start position, and thenI press the read button. (Beeps)So it's taking a little reading from you. (Beeps)And then the pointer goes and points to three different options.Let's see what happens here.(Beeps) Oh Bruno, you can go home, actually.BG: Great. Good news. (Applause)VV: So ... (Applause)So the thing about this is thatif the pointer, unfortunately, had pointed to the red spot,we would have to rush you to a hospital.Luckily, not today. And if it had pointed to the orangeor the amber, it basically meant you had to have,sort of, more continuous care from the health care worker.So that was a very simple three-step screening processthat could basically change the equationof how public health care works in so many different ways.BG: Thank you for the good news. VV: Yeah.(Applause)So, very briefly, I'll just explain to you how this is done,because that's the more interesting part.So essentially, the three things that are requiredto make this conversion from this guy to this guyis a cheap remote control for a televisionthat you can almost find in every home today,some parts from a computer mouse, basically,something that you can scavenge for very low cost,and a few parts that have to be pre-programmed.Basically this is a micro-controller with a fewextra components that can be shipped for very little costacross the world, and that's what is all requiredwith a little bit of local tinkering talentto convert the device into something else.So we are right now doing some systematic field teststo basically ascertain whether something like this actuallymakes sense to the ASHA worker.We are going through some reference tests to compare itagainst professional equipment to see if there's a degreeof change in efficacy and if it actually makes an impactin people's lives. But most importantly,what we are trying to do right nowis we are trying to scale this up, because thereare over 250,000 ASHA workers on the groundwho are these amazing foot soldiers, and if we cangive at least a fraction of them the access to these things,it just changes the way the economics of public health careworks, and it changes the way systems actually function,not just on a systematic planning level,but also in a very grassroots, bottom-up level.So that's it, and we hope to do this in a big way.Thank you. (Applause)(Applause)"Poetry of youth and age,https://www.ted.com/talks/c_k_williams_reads_poetry_of_youth_and_age?language=en,1-Feb,C.K. Williams,"219,335","TED Conference,Arts,Culture,Entertainment,Literature,Poetry,Society,Storytelling","I thought I would read poems I have that relate to the subjectof youth and age.I was sort of astonished to find out how many I have actually.The first one is dedicated toSpencer, and his grandmother, who was shocked by his work.My poem is called ""Dirt.""My grandmother is washing my mouth out with soap;half a long century goneand still she comes at mewith that thick cruel yellow bar.All because of a word I said,not even said really, only repeated.But ""Open,"" she says, ""open up!""her hand clawing at my head.I know now her life was hard;she lost three children as babies,then her husband died too,leaving young sons, and no money.She'd stand me in the sink to peebecause there was never room in the toilet.But oh, her soap!Might its bitter burning have beenwhat made me a poet?The street she lived on was unpaved,her flat, two cramped rooms and a fetid kitchenwhere she stalked and caught me.Dare I admit that after she did itI never really loved her again?She lived to a hundred,even then. All along it was the sadness, the squalor,but I never, until nowloved her again.When that was published in a magazineI got an irate letter from my uncle.""You have maligned a great woman.""It took some diplomacy.This is called ""The Dress.""It's a longer poem.In those days,those days which exist for me onlyas the most elusive memory now,when often the first sound you'd hear in the morningwould be a storm of birdsong,then the soft clop of the hoovesof the horse hauling a milk wagon down your block,and the last sound at night as likely as notwould be your father pulling up in his car,having worked late again, always late,and going heavily down to the cellar, to the furnace,to shake out the ashes and damp the draftbefore he came upstairs to fall into bed --in those long-ago days,women, my mother, my friends' mothers,our neighbors, all the women I knew --wore, often much of the day,what were called housedresses,cheap, printed, pulpy,seemingly purposefully shapelesslight cotton shifts that you wore over your nightgownand, when you had to go look for a child,hang wash on the line,or run down to the grocery store on the corner,under a coat,the twisted hem of the nightgownalways lank and yellowed,dangling beneath.More than the curlers some of the womenseemed constantly to have in their hairin preparation for some great event --a ball, one would think --that never came to pass;more than the way most women's facesnot only were never made up during the day,but seemed scraped, bleached,and, with their plucked eyebrows, scarily masklike;more than all that it was those dressesthat made women so unknowable and forbidding,adepts of enigmas to which men could have no access,and boys no conception.Only later would I see the dresses alsoas a proclamation:that in your dim kitchen, your laundry,your bleak concrete yard,what you revealed of yourselfwas a fabulation;your real sensual nature,veiled in those sexless vestments,was utterly your dominion.In those days, one hid much else as well:grown men didn't embrace one another,unless someone had died,and not always then; you shook handsor, at a ball game, thumped your friend's backand exchanged blows meant to be codes for affection;once out of childhood you'd never again knowthe shock of your father's whiskers on your cheek,not until mores at last had evolved,and you could hug another man, then hold on for a moment,then even kiss (your fathers bristleswhite and stiff now).What release finally, the embrace:though we were wary -- it seemed so audacious --how much unspoken joy there wasin that affirmation of equality and communion,no matter how much misunderstandingand pain had passed between you by then.We knew so little in those days,as little as now, I supposeabout healing those hurts:even the women, in their best dresses,with beads and sequins sewn on the bodices,even in lipstick and mascara,their hair aflow,could only stand wringing their hands,begging for peace,while father and son, like thugs,like thieves, like Romans,simmered and hissed and hated,inflicting sorrows that endured,the worst anyway,through the kiss and embrace,bleeding from brother to brother,into the generations.In those days there was still countrysideclose to the city, farms, cornfields, cows;even not far from our buildingwith its blurred brick and long shadowy hallwayyou could find tracts with hills and treesyou could pretend were mountains and forests.Or you could go out by yourselfeven to a half-block-long empty lot,into the bushes: like a creature of leaves you'd lurk,crouched, crawling, simplified, savage, alone;already there was wanting to be simpler,wanting, when they called you,never to go back.(Applause)This is another longish one,about the old and the young.It actually happened right at the time we met.Part of the poem takes place inspace we shared and time we shared.It's called ""The Neighbor.""Her five horrid, deformed little dogswho incessantly yap on the roof under my window.Her cats, God knows how many,who must piss on her rugs --her landing's a sickening reek.Her shadow once, fumbling the chain on her door,then the door slamming fearfully shut,only the barking and the music -- jazz --filtering as it does, day and night into the hall.The time it was Chris Connor singing ""Lush Life"" --how it brought back my college sweetheart,my first real love, who -- till I left her --played the same record.And head on my shoulder, hand on my thigh,sang sweetly along, of regrets and depletionsshe was too young for,as I was too young, later, to believe in her pain.It startled, then bored, then repelled me.My starting to fancy she'd ended up in this fire-trapin the Village, that my neighbor was her.My thinking we'd meet, recognize one another,become friends, that I'd accomplish a penance.My seeing her, it wasn't her, at the mailbox.Gray-yellow hair, army pants under a nightgown,her turning away, hiding her ravaged facein her hands, muttering an inappropriate ""Hi.""Sometimes there are frightening goings-on in the stairwell.A man shouting, ""Shut up!"" The dogs frantically snarling,claws scrabbling, then her -- her voicehoarse, harsh, hollow,almost only a tone,incoherent, a note, a squawk,bone on metal, metal gone molten,calling them back,""Come back darlings, come back dear ones.My sweet angels, come back.""Medea she was, next time I saw her.Sorceress, tranced, ecstatic,stock-still on the sidewalkragged coat hanging agape,passersby flowing around her,her mouth torn suddenly openas though in a scream,silently though, as though only in her brainor breast had it erupted.A cry so pure, practiced, detached,it had no need of a voice,or could no longer bear one.These invisible links that allure,these transfigurations, even of anguish, that hold us.The girl, my old love,the last lost time I saw herwhen she came to find me at a party,her drunkenly stumbling, falling,sprawling, skirt hiked, eyes veined red,swollen with tears, her shame,her dishonor.My ignorant, arrogant coarseness,my secret pride, my turning away.Still life on a rooftop,dead trees in barrels, a bench broken,dogs, excrement, sky.What pathways through pain,what junctures of vulnerability,what crossings and counterings?Too many lives in our lives already,too many chances for sorrow,too many unaccounted-for pasts.""Behold me,"" the god of frenzied,inexhaustible love says,rising in bloody splendor, ""Behold me.""Her making her waydown the littered vestibule stairs,one agonized step at a time.My holding the door.Her crossing the fragmented tiles,faltering at the step to the street,droning, not looking at me,""Can you help me?""Taking my arm, leaning lightly against me.Her wavering step into the world.Her whispering, ""Thanks love."" Lightly, lightly against me.(Applause)I think I'll lighten up a little.(Laughter)Another, different kind of poem of youth and age.It's called ""Gas.""(Laughter)Wouldn't it be nice, I think,when the blue-haired lady in the doctor's waiting roombends over the magazine tableand farts, just a little,and violently blushes.Wouldn't it be nice if intestinal gascame embodied in visible clouds,so she could see that her really quite inoffensive pophad only barely grazed my facebefore it drifted away.(Laughter)Besides, for this to have happened nowis a nice coincidence. Because not an hour ago,while we were on our walk,my dog was startled by a backfireand jumped straight up like a horse bucking.And that brought back to me the stableI worked on weekends when I was 12,and a splendid piebald stallion,who whenever he was mounted would buck just like that,though more hugely of course,enormous, gleaming, resplendent.And the woman, her face abashedly buriedin her ""Elle"" now, reminded me --I'd forgotten that not the least part of my aweconsisted of the fact that with every jump he tookthe horse would powerfully fart.Phwap! Phwap! Phwap!Something never mentionedin the dozens of books about horsesand their riders I devoured in those days.All that savage grandeur,the steely glinting hooves,the eruptions driven from the creature's mighty innards,breath stopped, heart stopped, nostrils madly flared,I didn't know if I wanted to break him, or be him.(Laughter)(Applause)This is called ""Thirst.""Many -- most of my poems actuallyare urban poems. I happen to be reading a bunch that aren't.""Thirst.""Here was my relation with the woman who lived all last autumn and winter,day and night, on a benchin the 103rd Street subway station,until finally one day she vanished.We regarded each other, scrutinized one another.Me shyly, obliquely, trying not to be furtive.She boldly, unblinkingly, even pugnaciously,wrathfully even, when her bottle was empty.I was frightened of her. I felt like a child.I was afraid some repressed part of myselfwould go out of control, and I'd be forever entrappedin the shocking seethe of her stench.Not excrement merely, not merely surfaceand orifice going unwashed,rediffusion of rum,there was will in it,and intention, power and purpose --a social, ethical rage and rebellion --despair too, though, grief, loss.Sometimes I'd think I should take her home with me,bathe her, comfort her, dress her.She wouldn't have wanted me to, I would think.Instead, I'd step into my train.How rich I would think, is the lexiconof our self-absolving.How enduring, our bland fatal assurancethat reflection is righteousness being accomplished.The dance of our glances,the clash, pulling each other throughour perceptual punctures,then holocaust, holocaust,host on host of ill, injured presences,squandered, consumed.Her vigil somewhere I know continues.Her occupancy, her absolute, faithful attendance.The dance of our glances, challenge, abdication,effacement, the perfume of our consternation.(Applause)This is a newer poem, a brand new poem.The title is ""This Happened.""A student, a young womanin a fourth-floor hallway of her lycee,perched on the ledge of an open windowchatting with friends between classes;a teacher passes and chides her,""Be careful, you might fall,""almost banteringly chides her,""You might fall,""and the young woman, 18, a girl really,though she wouldn't think that,as brilliant as she is, first in her class,and ""Beautiful, too,"" she's often told,smiles back, and leans into the open window,which wouldn't even be open if it were winter --if it were winter someone would have closed it (""Close it!"") --leans into the window, farther, still smiling,farther and farther, though it takes less timethan this, really an instant, and lets herself fall.Herself fall.A casual impulse, a fancy,never thought of until now, hardly thought of even now ...No, more than impulse or fancy,the girl knows what she's doing,the girl means something,the girl means to mean,because it occurs to her in that instant,that beautiful or not, bright yes or no,she's not who she is,she's not the person she is,and the reason, she suddenly knows,is that there's been so much premeditationwhere she is, so much plotting and planning,there's hardly a person where she is,or if there is, it's not her, or not wholly her,it's a self inhabited, lived in by her,and seemingly even as she thinks itshe knows what's been missing:grace,not premeditation but grace,a kind of being in the world spontaneously,with grace.Weightfully upon me was the world.Weightfully this self which graced the worldyet never wholly itself.Weightfully this self which weighed upon me,the release from which is what I desireand what I achieve.And the girl remembers, in this infinite instantalready now so many times divided,the sadness she felt once,hardly knowing she felt it,to merely inhabit herself.Yes, the girl falls, absurd to fall,even the earth with its compulsionto take unto itself all that fallsmust know that falling is absurd,yet the girl falling isn't myself,or she is myself,but a self I took of my own volition unto myself.Forever. With grace.This happened.(Applause)I'll read just one more. I don't usually say that.I like to just end.But I'm afraid that Ricky will come out hereand shake his fist at me.This is called ""Old Man,"" appropriately enough.""Special: big tits,""Says the advertisement for a soft-core magazineon our neighborhood newsstand.But forget her breasts.A lush, fresh-lipped blond,skin glowing gold, sprawls there,resplendent.60 nearly, yet these hardly tangible,hardly better than harlots, can still stir me.Maybe a coming of age in theAmerican sensual darkness,never seeing an unsmudged nipple,an uncensored vagina,has left me forever infectedwith an unquenchable lust of the eye.Always that erotic murmur,I'm hardly myselfif I'm not in a state of incipient desire.God knows though,there are worse twists your obsessions can take.Last year in Israel, a young ultra-orthodox Rabbiguiding some teenage girls through the Shrine of the Shoahforbade them to look in one room.Because there were images in it he said were licentious.The display was a photo. Men and women stripped naked,some trying to cover their genitals,others too frightened to bother,lined up in snowwaiting to be shot and thrown into a ditch.The girls, to my horror,averted their gaze.What carnal mistrust had their teacher taught them.Even that though. Another confession:Once in a book on pre-war Poland,a studio portrait, an absolute angel,an absolute angel with tormented, tormenting eyes.I kept finding myself at her page.That she died in the camps made her --I didn't dare wonder why --more present, more precious.Died in the camps, that too people --or Jews anyway --kept from their children back then.But it was like sex, you didn't have to be told.Sex and death, how close they can seem.So constantly conscious now of death moving towards me,sometimes I think I confound them.My wife's loveliness almost consumes me.My passion for her goes beyond reasonable bounds.When we make love, her holding meeverywhere all around me,I'm there and not there.My mind teems, jumbles of faces, voices, impressions,I live my life over, as though I were drowning.Then I am drowning, in despairat having to leave her,this, everything, all,unbearable, awful.Still, to be able to diewith no special contrition,not having been slaughtered, or enslaved.And not having to know history's nextmad rage or regression,it might be a relief.No. Again, no.I don't mean that for a moment.What I mean is the world holds me so tightly --the good and the bad --my own follies and weaknessthat even this counterfeit Venuswith her sham heat, and her bosom probably plumpedwith gel, so moves memy breath catches.Vamp. Siren. Seductress.How much more she revealsin her glare of ink than she knows.How she incarnatesour desperate human need for regard,our passion to live in beauty,to be beauty, to be cherished by glances,if by no more, of something like love,or love.Thank you.(Applause)"
